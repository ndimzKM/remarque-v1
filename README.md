# EditNote
A note taking web app for developers. It connects to an external express API which is cabale of CRUD operations. 

External API where data is fetched from is hosted locally on a JSON Server, so you might need to setup your own server on __port 3333__ with the __/notes__ endpoint available.

## Note:(no pun intended)
1. Almost all logic is implemented in the public/app.js file.
2. I used SCSS heavily so you might need to compile the entire public/css folder
