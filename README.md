# EditNote
A note taking web app for developers. It connects to an external express API which is cabale of CRUD operations. 
You can set up your own instance by creating a .env file and adding the following:

NODE_EXPRESS_API=url to your node api
PORT=port number

You can use clone to repo below to get the express API I originally used if you don't want to create your own.

## Note:(no pun intended)
1. Almost all logic is implemented in the public/app.js file.
2. I used SCSS heavily so you might need to compile the entire public/css folder
